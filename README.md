# ImageToTMX

Summary: Convert image to a Tiled TMX map

The purpose of this utility is to be able to use a procedural map generator to generate a world map or a level map as an image, then convert it to a TMX file to be further modified using the Tiled Map Editor (https://www.mapeditor.org/ )

The colors of the image will be mapped to tile IDs in a sprite map.
